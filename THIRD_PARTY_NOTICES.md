Syncthing is a separate executable work. Its source files remain under their upstream licenses; Lumen Sync's Apache-2.0 license does not replace them. The native build is reproducible from the pinned tag with `./gradlew :composeApp:buildSyncthingDesktop` or `./gradlew :composeApp:buildSyncthingAndroid`.
